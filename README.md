This project is a way to show how an in-game videogame characters specs are identified through back-end coding. For anyone who doesn't know what that means, it means it shows the numerical progress that one would make in a video game if their character(user designated component that they directly interact with) was going through a level up system, which is a system that marks progress through a video game based on achievements. It's okay if you still don't understand, there are comments in the code that can give somewhat of an idea of what is happening.
There was a bit of difficulty getting to find out how to describe the overall state of Ken in the code when the program ran, but I managed to do it after tampering with the codes if/else statements.
Paste the code into something like visual studio code, or online-python.com/online_python_compiler ,and set the language to Python and run the program. Answer the questions in the comments to receive the necessary results. Enjoy!

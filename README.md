# This project is a way to show how an in-game videogame characters specs are identified through back-end coding. For anyone who doesn't know what that means, it means it shows the numerical progress that one would make in a video game if their character was going through a level up system. It's okay if you still don't understand, there are comments in the code that can give somewhat of an idea of what is happening.
# There was a bit of difficulty getting to find out how to describe the overall state of Ken in the code when the program was runned, but I managed to do it after tampering with the code. 
# Paste the code into something like visual studio code, or online-python.com/online_python_compiler, set the language to Python and run the program. Answer the questions to receive the necessary results in the comments. Enjoy!
